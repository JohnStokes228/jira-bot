# why though mate?

this is a very quick piece of code just so i could get to grips with the MCP architecture - now that ive got the basics down I'll be moving on to other, actually interesting examples. Ultimately my goal was:

- get a model to use at least two separate servers
- get a model to use at least one remote server
- uderstand how to spin up a local client
  
which i feel I have successfully achieved here, even if i did it with the most boring corpo use case possible lololol.
